                <h1>The UK's largest sofa specialist</h1>
                <p>
                    We just do sofas and big doesn't mean unfriendly in our case as you'll see when you visit
                    Well that sounds grand doesn't it? Maybe, but it's true. We are by far the largest specialist sofa retailer in the UK but we didn't plan it that way, it just happened.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We set out to leave people feeling at home on a sofa they loved and it just caught on. We also set out to offer the best value too and as the largest specialist, our buying power now means we can pass those savings on to you... It's all about great service, great sofas, great prices and finding the one that will leave you feeling at home on a sofa you love. We hope you like it...

                <h1>Honest low pricing every day</h1>
                <p>
                    The "sale ends Sunday", "50% off if you buy today" you've seen it all and so have we. And we actually know how it's done too!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our concept of value you simply pay less and get more. We don't mislead you with clever pricing that goes up and down like a YoYo, we simply start at the lowest price we can and stay low. It just seems easier that way. You can trust our pricing and we're sure that you can't buy the same sofa for less, partly because every sofa we offer is exclusive and partly because we like really low prices.

                    Our visualisation systems now allow you to see over 250,000 sofas in the colour and configuration you want
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagination is great for fairy tales and dreams but for the real world of buying the right sofa, it just doesn't cut it. That's why we have spent several years building one of the most sophisticated visualisation systems to let you see everything we do both in store and online before you buy it. Seeing everything in the right colour and configuration is key and really helps in making the right decisions and the new large format screens in store take it to another level (rolling out now).

                <h1>If it's leather you want, it's leather you get</h1>
                <p>
                    We don't use leather substitutes or PVC on any part of our furniture
                </p>
                <p>
                    Did you know that the sofas you see that look like leather often aren't. Ouch, gasp I hear! It's true. In order to reduce costs, many retailers now sell sofas made from "leather look" fabrics, fabrics made from leather, PVC and other man made substitutes. They even mix the real thing with the substitutes too. Not a great idea we can tell you. At Sofology we don't use substitutes ever! That's it!

                <h1>No pressure from sales people on commission</h1>
                <p>
                    The gift of the gab and someone chasing you around trying to sell you something. In fact trying to sell you anything! It's not for us. We don't like anything about it. It creates rushed and bad decisions, a bad experience and often misleading information from people who have little or no product knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike almost every other sofa retailer in the UK, Sofology simply doesn't have sales people on commission. Our teams are trained to offer great advice and are rewarded for the service they give by your ratings, not ours. It makes everything more honest, less rushed and results in a better sofa for you.

                <p>
                    Confidence is attractive, so we must be beautiful. We offer a 20 year structural guarantee on every sofa range we offer and a 2 year extended guarantee on everything else. Why? Because we know them inside out...

                <h1>Expert delivery and installation by our own fully trained teams every time</h1>
                <p>
                    A square peg in a round hole. Sofa delivery is hard. Large oddly shaped items going into tight spaces, through narrow doors and corridors. So much can go wrong. Not only that, there's lots to cover once you have it installed to help you get the best from it. That's why we have our own unique team of very specially trained introducers. We don't call them delivery men because that would be rude. They are trained in our unique training facilities at every one of our 6 distribution centres to install your sofas safely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are trained to boldly go (with a sofa) where no one has gone before (sorry, treky reference!), and are qualified in installation, technical repair and introduction. It's not just another delivery, so relax, have a brew and get ready to be comfortable.
